# Computer-Vision
Exploring computer vision with OpenCV

### Multi-object tracking:
- The application uses OpenCV3 built-in object trackers to track multiple objects in the given videos. If the videos are provided, the application will automatically connect to Webcam and operate object tracking through the computer camera.

### Document scanner:
- The application receives input as an picture of a document, taken at maximum 45 degrees skewed away from the vertical axis; it then detects the document in the picture and outputs the front-view of the document along with the readable texts on the document. The read text accuracy depends on the picture quality.
